1.05 2024-02-18
* When the weather station console data buffer is full the first 2 packets
  contain misleading rain information - the first 2 data packets are now
  suppressed

1.04 2023-05-19
* Update to readme.txt for installation changes for weewx v5.

1.03 2021-03-30
* A log.info at the end of the constructor had 3 string parameters but only 2
  "%s" to use these (this causes an error in Python 3.8.7, in Python 3.7.3 no
  error but the log.info was ignored)

1.02 2020-11-28
* Updated supported weather stations (readme.txt) to include WS 5 in 1
  weather stations from Bresser and Logia.  Manufacturer is CCL Electronics.
* Added new optional 'WsType' parameter.  If set to WS5in1 this will suppress
  the UV packet from being passed to weewx (5in1 weather stations don't
  support UV).

1.01 2020-11-08
* since_ts also needs checking its not null in genStartupRecords

1.0 2020-11-07
* Fix issue in decode for archive where last_ts can be None if database is
  empty
* readme.txt updated installation instructions, warning for WiFi 6 in 1
  weatherstations not being compatible
* Updated to version 1.0

0.9 2020-09-08
* LocalTime issue with backfill fixed (thanks ArendPWS).  Note: There are
  potential problems with summertime changeovers.  See readme.txt
* HeatIndex is now decoded and passed to weewx (thanks ArendPWS)
* rainRate is now properly passed from the console (thanks ArendPWS)

0.8 2020-06-22
* ArendPWS reports that wind direction can have value '---' if it is absent, so
  added this check to the get_int decoder utility.
* 'model' is optionally supported in the weewx.conf file within the WS6in1 area.

0.7 2020-06-14
* When bad values are recieved ws6in1 now rejects that set of readings in case
  any missing data items are then associated with the wrong parameters.
* Discovery of pylint/3 and pyflakes/3 - used to tidy code and fix some minor
  issues
* Addition of csv_ws6in1 standalone program to download the contents of the
  data buffer from the WS6in1 weather station console.

0.6 2020-06-08
* Fix issue that prevented weewx stopping when stop command issued

0.5 2020-06-06
* Improved error handling to prevent weewx exiting if bad data is received

0.4 2020-05-17
* Defect fix: Fixed crash if console buffer is empty
* Additional info in log statements
* Commented out the archive_interval function - this is better set from
  weewx [stdArchive], as the weather station archive records are only read at
  startup.
* set usb call timeouts to 30 seconds (was thousands of seconds)
* improved handling of timeout errors

0.3 2020-05-16
* Added genStartupRecords.  This adds missing records from the console data log
  at weewx startup
* Replaced all "print" statements with log.debug, log.info log.error or
  log.critical statements

0.2 2020-04-27
* Added setTime function.  This sets the time time on the WS console on
  initialisation and every 24 hours.
* Implemented decoding of the optional extra 7 temperature/humidity sensors
* Tidy up of the code

0.1 2020-03-12
* initial release
